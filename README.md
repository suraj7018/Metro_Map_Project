# Metro Map Project

This project provides a C++ implementation for managing and visualizing a metro map. It includes functionalities to represent metro stations, routes, and connections, allowing users to explore and analyze the metro network efficiently.

## Features

- Representation of metro stations and routes
- Visualization of metro connections
- Efficient algorithms for route finding and network analysis

## Usage

1. Compile the `Metromap.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the generated executable (`Metromap.exe`) to interact with the metro map functionalities.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, MSVC)
- Windows OS (for provided executable)
